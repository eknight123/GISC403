	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
	This is a map showing 4 point markers which represent 4 key spots in of importance to me in New Zealand.
	The points of interest are seen as Hokitika, Christchurch, Auckland, and Geraldine. They also have the 
	reason of interst within the pop up markers. The pink polygon represents another place of importance but
	symbolised in a different way. This also has the reason for importance in the pop up marker. The colours
	chosen have been chosen in a way that differentiates from the other layers so everything can be easily 
	identified and uses the viewers assumption where neccessary. The underlying basemap was created in box map 
	and correctly shows the labels and appropriate cartographic elements for the use of this map. The map has 
	been appropriately scaled to highlight New Zealand and show the key points of interest.
